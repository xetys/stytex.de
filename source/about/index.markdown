My name is David, and I'm just a software architect with the aim of giving back some knowledge back to the world. In the end of 2015 I had the thought of there are so many programmers out there, who grind through GitHub and Stack Overflow by learning from other people. I found it was time for me, after years of consuming such sources, start producing them, too. So this blog appeared.

Since September 2016 I am a member of the JHipster core development team, focused on security and operating microservices. With over 15 years experience in web and application development, I passionate researching and build modern cloud applications, security solutions and I love to bring knowledge about open source technology to developers and to contribute back to the OS community.

With this in hand, I've got insights into today's problems around topics like designing microservices architecture, how to build and operate CI and CD pipelines in various ways (Jenkins, GitLabCI), managing production environments (kubernetes, bare-metal, terraform,...) and further topics like Spring Boot/Cloud, Angular, TDD, Scrum, etc.

My current research and self-learning focus is on Kubernetes.
